This project is done through using React Hooks such as useState and useEffect. In addition to these, array methods filter and map are implemented in order to increase the 

cleanness of the code. Usage of state in functional components and fetching data from an API through axios can be learned in this very example. 


The user can reach the personal information of a random user including his/her name, age, email, location, phone number, and password through clicking the icons.

Additionally, it is possible to search for a new profile while adding the particular ones into the table without repeat.
